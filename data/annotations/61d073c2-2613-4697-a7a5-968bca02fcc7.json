But if you have no limitations, such as marriage, or commitment to someone, I say, having friends with males and females is good. It is okay. I approve it.

I was born in Titus County, and when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whit- White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees and or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swimming on a vine. In this spring I fly kites, and summer nights, and we catch fireflies, but we call to them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have flights with corn cobs or prin- pine corns. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a fire store Tire shop. Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hoppin john, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I grip about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch of our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Transcript, Speaker"}],"uuid":"f54b7ae9-c8dd-43b5-b86f-3d5515479ceb"},{"start_time":2346,"end_time":2360,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Okay, perfect.
